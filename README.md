Good, but not great. But good.

I'm a front end developer, I love VueJS and this is the framework I chose to work with! Why? You may ask. Well, it's simple and I don't like overengineering. At the end of the day, Javascript is what really matters so we can slice stuff and filter some data. :) 

I'm currently learning and improving my back end skills with NodeJS + Typescript + Prisma + GraphQL.
