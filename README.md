Front End Developer ðŸ–¥

Currently working with: HTML + CSS + JS + VUE + GRAPHQL + POSTGRES

I just like developing cool stuff, I'm not the greatest developer around, I'm not a reference, I'm just here to create amazing features for amazing companies and this is how it should be. No ego allowed, this is how I can see my flaws and improve what I already know.
