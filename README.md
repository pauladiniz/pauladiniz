10 years working in the field and my family still has no idea what's my actual job.

Most of my work is for private repos and tied to a different GH account (@itsmepaula).

My current stack is VueJS, Tailwind, Node, Prisma, GraphQL and Postgres. But honestly I just enjoy solving problems that will actually make a difference.
